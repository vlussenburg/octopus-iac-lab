# GitHub PAT exposed to the argocd namespace so Argo's ApplicationSet
# SCM Provider generator can reach the GitHub API at the higher
# (5000 req/hr) authenticated rate limit instead of 60 req/hr anonymous.
# Public-repo lookups work without auth, but the cap bites quickly with
# multiple branches + a 30s requeue interval.
#
# Only created when this worktree owns the argocd install — the secret
# only needs to exist once per cluster, and the local worktree is the
# canonical owner of cluster-scoped argocd resources by convention.
