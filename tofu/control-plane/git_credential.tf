# PAT-based credential Octopus uses to read/write OCL in the CaC repo.
# Username can be anything when authenticating GitHub with a PAT — the PAT
# carries the identity.
#
# `repository_restrictions` pins the credential to this single repo URL on
# the Octopus side: even if a project somewhere else in the Space tried to
# point at a different repo with this credential, Octopus would refuse.
# Defence-in-depth on top of the PAT's GitHub-side scope (which should also
# be a fine-grained PAT limited to vlussenburg/octopus-iac-lab Contents R/W).
